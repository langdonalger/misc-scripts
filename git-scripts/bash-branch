# BASH script to show Git branch in prompt.
#
# This script will show the current Git branch in the prompt, eg:
#    [directory branch]
#
# Where "directory" is the current directory, and "branch" is the current
# branch.  Ofcourse "PS1" can be modified to whatever particular style of
# prompt is preferred, just ensure that "$(branch)" is called if branch display
# is desired.
#
# To use this, put it within "~/.bash_profile" or "~/.bashrc", or ensure that
# it is source'd from either file.

function branch
{
	git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/^*//'
}

PS1='[\[\e[34m\]\W\[\e[0m\]\[\e[31m\]$(branch)\[\e[0m\]] '
